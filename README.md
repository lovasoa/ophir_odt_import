# ODT import module for Drupal
## Description
This is a very simple module that imports ODT files into drupal.

The generated HTML markup is simple, and *not all odt features are supported*.

This is based on a PHP script that converts ODT files to HTML.
So the set of supported ODT features is the one of this script: https://github.com/lovasoa/ophir.php

## Installation instructions
In drupal, choose __Modules__ > __Import from URL__

Enter the following url: <code>https://github.com/lovasoa/ophir.php/archive/master.zip</code>

Et voil√†.
