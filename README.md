# ODT import module for Drupal
## Description
This is a very simple module that imports ODT files into drupal.

The generated HTML markup is simple, and not all odt features are supported.

This is based on a PHP script that converts ODT files to HTML, that you can find here: https://github.com/lovasoa/ophir.php

## Installation instructions
In drupal, choose
   Modules > Import from URL
Enter the following url:
    https://github.com/lovasoa/ophir.php/archive/master.zip
You're done
